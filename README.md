# Awesome portals for learning CPP

[learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/)   
훌륭한 예제와 위트있는 설명 다른곳에서는 말하지 않은 모든 case들이 예시로 나와있으며 이는 지식을 단단하게 만들어준다!   

[CPP reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)   
개념과 사용처가 아주 간단하고 자세하게 정의되어 있다    

[CPP 표준의 공식 웹사이트](https://isocpp.org/)   
C++ 표준 재단이 관리하는 웹사이트로 대표적으로는 C++에 대한 가이드라인이 존재한다
